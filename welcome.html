    <p>We at the CDL are thrilled to have you here with us!</p>
    <p>The CDL highly values the work we're able to do with students, from teaching them about the nuts and bolts of computing to the more nuanced concepts related to how society influences digital practice, to seeing them apply knowledge from both of these areas to their academic, professional, and personal lives. It's truly a delight to have the opportunity to work with you all.</p>
    <h3>So, what's this course all about?</h3>
    <p>This course is offered through the Center for Digital Learning at Geneseo as a primer for students accepted into the Student Affiliate program.</p>
    <p>The CDL was first established in July 2020 and its Director and Digital Humanities and Learning Coordinator were fortunate enough to have several students from a class offered in Spring 2020 called <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://dh.sunygeneseoenglish.org/courses/english-340/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ENGL 340: Literature and Literary Study in the Digital Age</a> ready to go with backgrounds in the kinds of skills and modes of thinking we're looking to cultivate in our Student Affiliates. These students were key to helping us understand what topics surrounding digital practice are typically the most confusing, interesting, and concerning to students. Now, we're taking what we've learned from teaching classes like ENG 340 and the first cohort of Student Affiliates, and applying those insights to this training course.</p>
    <p><strong>This course is a sampler, if you will, of topics, skills, tools, and ethics related to computing, particularly associated with higher education. </strong>You'll learn a bit about the history of computers and computing, text editing, working with your computer using built-in tools like the command line, what the web is (versus the internet) and how to create web content, and how to share your content. Throughout these modules, we'll talk about the technical quite a bit, but also spend some time discussing the theoretical and the societal implications of digital practice.</p>
    <h3>What will I be doing?</h3>
    <p>First and foremost, we want to make sure you're&nbsp;<em>learning</em>!&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While we certainly hope that you'll be able to help us out with some of the work we do in this center supporting faculty, staff, and other students in their digital endeavors, our number one priority in offering you this experience is making sure you learn what you're interested in learning. That means that we're very flexible and responsive to how&nbsp;<em>you</em> want to see this experience unfold for&nbsp;<em>you</em>!</p>
    <p>Some specific expectations we have are that you:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>maintain <strong>weekly journal entries</strong> that are pushed to GitHub reflecting on what you've learned that week, what questions you have, what it makes you think about, and what you'd like to learn more about.</li>
        <li>publish at least one <strong>well-developed, reflective blog post</strong> to the CDL website via GitHub, one at midterm time, and the other as your final. The number and length of these posts will be determined by the amount of credit hours you're completing for this experience.</li>
        <li>read <strong>assigned articles and excerpts </strong>about digital practices, tools, and trends.</li>
        <li>attend as many <strong>weekly Student Affiliate meetings</strong> as possible. These are where we'll go through the course modules, expand on topics, do hands-on computing activities, and create a community amongst ourselves.</li>
        <li>identify and (possibly) develop a <strong>web-based project</strong> individually or collaboratively.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you're taking this experience for academic credit, these expectations are mandatory in order to earn credit. However, if you're&nbsp;<em>not</em> applying for credit as part of this experience, we can be more flexible with these expectations. Furthermore, depending on the number of credits you're seeking, the hours dedicated to each activity will vary.</p>
    <p>We hope you're as excited as we are. There's LOTS to cover, so let's get started!</p>
