    <p>As we've been discussing up to this point, HTML is a presentational markup language; it dictates how information is displayed on a webpage. We've even gone as far as to stress the difference between HTML and code, highlighting the transformational and interactive nature of programming languages in contrast to the layout and display foundation of markup languages.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>That being said, there are a few significant HTML functionalities that a typical user may not notice from the display page, but that make a big impact on how many different types of users can interact with a site.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>UI/UX and SEO</h2>
    <p>Yes, more acronyms.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>UI/UX, or, User Interface/User Experience, starts at the HTML level. If the HTML of a webpage is properly set up, it's easier for interface and experience designers to build effective styles and interactions.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While HTML is primarily associated with formatting, a lot of the work it does is descriptive and structural. These behind-the-scene features are what make the site run smoothly across browsers, assistive technology, and search engines. SEO, or, Search Engine Optimization, heavily relies on the metadata that's included in a site's HTML.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Read the following article to learn more about how this works: <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://searchengineland.com/guide/seo/html-code-search-engine-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML Code &amp; Search Engine Success Factors.</a></p>
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>As explained in the Digital Humanities Research Institute GitHub repository on HTML and CSS,&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>Creating websites also involves making sure that it is designed to be accessible for those with disabilities. If your website displays images, then each image should also contain alt text metadata that describes the image such that it is usable for screenreaders. Screenreaders make websites accessible for those with visual and/or auditory disabilities. Similarly, if your website involves showcasing audio-based information (like interviews or lectures) then you should provide a transcription of the audio. We will go over basic practices of making websites accessbile in this workshop. You can learn more about accessibility standards and guidelines at the W3C's page on Web Accessibility. Furthermore, there are also services like the WAVE tool that help identify ways of making websites more accessible.</blockquote>
    <p>It's important, therefore, to understand how to use HTML features like headings, alt text, hyperlinked text, and so on.</p>
