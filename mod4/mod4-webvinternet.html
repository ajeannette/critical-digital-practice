    <p>Hint: <em>they're not the same.</em></p>
    <p>Have you ever caught yourself using the terms "web" and "internet" interchangeably? Have you ever not even noticed because you've never tried to distinguish between these two words? You're not alone.</p>
    <p>The web and the internet are, in fact, two distinct concepts. The&nbsp;<strong>web</strong> describes the <em>collection of information </em>that is accessed through the&nbsp;<strong>internet</strong>, which is the <em>network framework that connects that information </em>across the world. As explained in Hoffman's <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/341866/how-does-the-internet-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"How Does the Internet Work"</a>, this network is made up of a combination of software and hardware. While it is tempting to think that the internet exists simply out in the ether, it is, in fact, optimized by underground&mdash;and even undersea&mdash; cables and satellites; massive structures that hold our global society together. The information that travels over the internet is referred to as "packets" that transfer between computers by following a path of routers. This process ensures that information gets where it needs to go, because if one connection goes down, another can be picked up relatively easily, keeping packets moving and information flowing.</p>
    <h2>What's my route?</h2>
    <p>If you want to see what route your computer takes to request and deliver information, there's a command for that.</p>
    <h3>Mac/Linux</h3>
    <p><code>traceroute cdl-geneseo.github.io</code>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p><code><span>tracert cdl-geneseo.github.io</span></code>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You might not be able to make out anything immediately intelligible from the results, but you can at least see that the information is going to various sources. If your results don't seem to stop loading after 5 or 6 pings, feel free to <code>^C</code> to stop it.</p>
