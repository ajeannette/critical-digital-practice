    <h2>The move from HTML to XHTML to HTML5</h2>
    <p>We talk about "HTML" in this course, and it might seem like there's only one. But that's actually a little misleading. While we'll continue to use the general term "HTML," we're actually referring to HTML5, the latest version of the language.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The original version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993 and, since then, there have been many different versions, but only a couple that have been widely adopted on the web. By 1999, HTML 4.0 was the standard, only lasting until XHTML came in as a complete rewrite of HTML as XML and was quickly standardized in 2000.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>XML stands for e<strong>X</strong>tensible&nbsp;<strong>M</strong>arkup&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>anguage, and there are hundreds of languages built on top of it. In general, XML is a very strict language that is highly descriptive and has a much more general application than HTML, which is strictly for the web. XML's key feature is its extensibility; it allows you to make your own tags and is fundamentally interoperable. That's why there are hundreds of different versions, from GML (Geography Markup Language), to MathML, to MusicML, and TEI (Text Encoding Initiative). All of these languages are supported by a multitude of applications and platforms, so sharing and experimenting with different ways to display and explore data is a breeze.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, and was officially released for widespread use in 2014, although its development started around 2008. This version is considered by the organizations that developed it&mdash; W3C and WHATWG&mdash; to be a "living standard;" something that will be continuously improved as time goes on and relevant advancements are made.</p>
    <h3>Another "win" for open source</h3>
    <p>Perhaps the biggest change that came with HTML5 is its ability to add audio and video to sites with a single tag. This was a game changer when it first came out.</p>
    <p>Some of you may remember visiting websites, like YouTube, a number of years ago when Adobe Flash dominated the web. If you wanted to stream any videos directly in your browser as a user, you had to have the Adobe Flash plugin, which included maintaining that plugin via updates. <strong>Adobe Flash is proprietary software,</strong> and it is a golden example of what's wrong with relying on tools and platforms that are not open source, especially when they're expected to serve as a core functionality in an environment as inherently open as the internet.</p>
    <p>As outlined by Ionos, late Apple CEO, Steve Jobs, gave the following reasons for "rejecting" Flash in 2007:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <ol>
            <li>Adobe Flash is a closed, proprietary software</li>
            <li>Nearly all video content is also available in the modern H.264 format</li>
            <li>Adobe Flash is unsafe and unstable</li>
            <li>Flash significantly reduces the battery life of mobile devices</li>
            <li>The Flash standard is not suitable for touch devices</li>
            <li>Flash is an impeding layer between platform and programmer</li>
        </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These reasons are largely specific to the iPhone, but include key issues that affect all users regarding Flash. Namely, how "unsafe and unstable" Flash had proven to be as "a popular target for malware developers." It became increasingly difficult for Adobe to keep up with its security patches to address this issue, and, eventually, the open source HTML5 alternative to Flash won the day.</p>
