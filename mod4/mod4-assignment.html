<p>For this activity you're going to make a webpage on GitHub.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Flat-file</h2>
<p>We're going to keep it "old school" here by <strong>creating a flat-file website</strong>, which, unlike fully configured platforms like WordPress, are simply a collection of individual text files stored somewhere on your server, rather than in a database. Flat-file websites are fantastic for:</p>
<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li id="8161" class="lf lg hy ix b iy iz jc jd jg lh jk li jo lj js lk ll lm ln gi" data-selectable-paragraph="">Simplicity</li>
        <li id="9324" class="lf lg hy ix b iy lo jc lp jg lq jk lr jo ls js lk ll lm ln gi" data-selectable-paragraph="">Speed</li>
        <li id="a90d" class="lf lg hy ix b iy lo jc lp jg lq jk lr jo ls js lk ll lm ln gi" data-selectable-paragraph="">Security</li>
        <li id="92a6" class="lf lg hy ix b iy lo jc lp jg lq jk lr jo ls js lk ll lm ln gi" data-selectable-paragraph="">Version Control</li>
        <li id="bbd9" class="lf lg hy ix b iy lo jc lp jg lq jk lr jo ls js lk ll lm ln gi" data-selectable-paragraph="">Portability and maintenance</li>
        <li id="c6d5" class="lf lg hy ix b iy lo jc lp jg lq jk lr jo ls js lk ll lm ln gi" data-selectable-paragraph="">Less expense to run</li>
    </ul>

<p>(<a class="inline_disabled" href="https://medium.com/@yuzool/what-is-a-flat-file-cms-bac76760b40d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is a Flat-File CMS?</a>)</p>
<p>Content Management Systems (CMSs) are great for this, and a particularly popular one that we use here at the CDL, called Jekyll, is made for GitHub pages. These CMSs, essentially, provide powerful templates for your content and files, relieving you from a <em>lot</em> of work. However, we won't be using a flat-file CMS for this activity <em>either</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, rather, you're going to build all of the pages you need for this website from scratch. What you'll end up with will certainly not be as fancy as most modern websites, and, in fact, will likely be pretty reminiscent of older site styling such as MySpace and other early-aught webpages. But, much like the creators of those sites, you'll learn a ton. Don't worry, it'll be fun!</p>
<h3>The website</h3>
<p>Your website can be on any topic, but there are a few things that you should include.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You site should have more than one page, be navigable, have a header, footer, and a style.</p>
<h2>The steps</h2>
<p>To complete this activity, you'll need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a GitHub repository and name it&nbsp;<em>yourusername</em>.github.io.</li>
    <li>Clone your repository to your computer.</li>
    <li>Create an <code>index.html</code> file in your repository folder.</li>
    <li>Create a <code>style.css</code> file in your repository folder and link to it in your <code>index.html</code> file.</li>
    <li>Create!</li>
</ol>
<p>When you're finished with this activity, post the link to your GitHub repository in the Teams chat.</p>
