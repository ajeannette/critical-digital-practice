    <h2>Understanding "text"</h2>
    <p><span>When I was in elementary school, I thought I was going to be a writer. I would spend hours and hours on my dad's desktop computer, typing away at stories and make-believe newspapers in Microsoft Word. As far as I knew back then, that was the only way to write on a computer. Every day after school I would be dropped off by my bus at my grandparents' house to wait for my dad to pick me up a couple of hours later, when he got out of work. For a burgeoning child-writer, these hours were torturous, because, while I could keep my stories on a flash drive to move to other computers as needed, the computer at my grandparents' house&nbsp;<em>did not have Microsoft Word on it.</em> What was I to do? All of my amazing ideas for what I was already working on festered in my brain, and the itch to concoct and consider and knock words into place on the page as I typed gnawed against my little tween angst. It was beyond frustrating.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>And when I learned about the built-in text editor on Windows (the only OS my family would allow... we all have our loyalties, I suppose), Notepad? Imagine my elation, then almost instant, crushing devastation when there was still no way to open my MS Word document in that platform. Why was it so impossible to view what I wrote in a different program? It was only text, anyhow, plain and simple... right?</span></p>
    <p><span>As scholars working with computers, we need to be aware of the ways plain text and formatted text differ. Words on a screen may have hidden formatting. Many of us grew up using Microsoft Word and don't realize how much is going on behind the words shown on the screen. For the purposes of communicating with the computer and for easier movement between different programs, we need to use text without hidden formatting.</span></p>
    <p><span><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://canvas.geneseo.edu/courses/20408/files/1882544/preview" alt="A Microsoft Word Document with the sentence, &quot;This is a Word Document with one sentence.&quot;" width="739" height="466" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.geneseo.edu/api/v1/courses/20408/files/1882544" data-api-returntype="File" /></span></p>
    <p><span>Looks simple enough. But, there's actually quite a bit going on under the hood, so to speak. Let's do an exercise together to reveal precisely what we're dealing with when we look at seemingly bare-bones document like this.</span></p>
    <h3>Step one: take a peek using&nbsp;<code>cat</code></h3>
    <p>Let's take a moment and view this document using the command line. Feel free to follow along if you have MS Word on your computer. Remember, you get a <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://wiki.geneseo.edu/display/cit/Software+at+Geneseo#:~:text=MATLAB%20Installation%20Guide-,Microsoft%20Office,-current%20version%3A%20latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free license to the MS Office suite</a> as Geneseo students!</p>
    <p>First, <a class="instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled" title="WordDoc-demo.docx" href="https://canvas.geneseo.edu/courses/20408/files/1883160?wrap=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-canvas-previewable="false" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.geneseo.edu/api/v1/courses/20408/files/1883160" data-api-returntype="File">download this Word Document</a> and put it somewhere easily accessible on your computer. Mine is on my Desktop.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Now, let's read this file in the command line. You'll need to navigate to where the file is saved on your computer&mdash;or type in the full path as I did&mdash;and use the <code>cat</code> command to view your file.</p>
    <p><code>% cat ~/Desktop/WordDoc-demo.docx</code></p>
    <p>Whoa, are you seeing what I'm seeing? Absolute nonsense? Don't worry, if this is making you too uncomfortable, punch in&nbsp;<code>clear</code> at the prompt and it'll all go away. That's better.</p>
    <p>Word documents which look like "just words!" are actually comprised of an archive of extensible markup language (XML) instructions that only Microsoft Word can read. Plain text files can be opened in a number of different editors and can be read within the command line. Let's think about this a little more before we move on.</p>
    <h4>Plain text</h4>
    <p>For the purposes of communicating with machines and between machines, we need characters to be as flexible as possible. Plain text include characters of readable material but not graphical representation.</p>
    <p>According to the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a class="external" href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.1.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Unicode Standard</span></a>, "Plain text is a pure sequence of character codes; plain Unicode-encoded text is therefore a sequence of Unicode character codes."</p>
    <p>Plain text has two main properties in regard to rich text: "plain text is the underlying content stream to which formatting can be applied. Plain text is public, standardized, and universally readable."</p>
    <p>Plain text shows its cards&mdash;if it's marked up, the markup will be human readable. Plain text can be moved between programs more fluidly and can respond to programmatic manipulations. Because it is not tied to a particular font or color or placement, plain text can be styled externally, such as through CSS on the web.</p>
    <p>A counterpoint to plain text is rich text (sometimes denoted by the Microsoft rich text format ".rtf" file extension) or "enriched text" (sometimes seen as an option in email programs). In rich text files, plain text is elaborated with formatting specific to the program in which they are made.</p>
    <h4>Text editors</h4>
    <p>An important tool for programming and working in the command line is a text editor. A text editor is a program that allows you to edit plain text files, such as .txt, .csv, or .md. Text editors are not used to edit rich text documents, such as .docx or .rtf, and rich text editors should not be used to edit plain text files. This is because rich text editors will add many invisible special characters that will prevent programs from running and configuration files from being read correctly.</p>
    <p>While it doesn't really matter which text editor you choose, you should try to become comfortable with at least one text editor.</p>
    <h4>Default recommendation</h4>
    <p>Choosing a text editor has as much to do with personality as it does with functionality. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs), user options, and "hackability" vary from program to program. The Center for Digital Learning uses<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="external" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Visual Studio Code</span></a>. Not only is Visual Studio Code free and open source, but it is also consistent across OSX, Windows, and Linux systems. VS Code also provides syntax highlighting and version control, which we'll talk more about later in the course.</p>
    <p>You will have downloaded VS Code according to the<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="external" href="https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/vscode.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>instructions</span></a><span> earlier in this course.</span></p>
    <h3>Step two: deconstructing the MS Word doc</h3>
    <p>Let's see what's behind that seemingly simple .docx file. If you didn't already, you'd never know that an MS Word document is really a .zip file with all sorts of components that make up that final, powerful, pretty word processor in which you can view and edit your documents. Let's reveal its true form.</p>
    <p>In order to do this, we need to, effectively, rename our document from WordDoc-demo.docx to WordDoc-demo.zip. A not-so-intuitive but highly efficient way to do this from the command line is to use the&nbsp;<code>mv</code> command.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><code>% mv ~/Desktop/WordDoc-demo.docx ~/Desktop/WordDoc-demo.zip</code>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Now, you won't see anything drastic happen here, you'll just notice, if you&nbsp;<code>ls</code> where your file is, that the extension has changed from .docx to .zip. In order to see what's actually inside this folder, we'll need to run another command. Typically, .zip files are compressed folders, handy for transporting, and to unzip them you would simply "Expand" or double-click. You'll notice that if you try and do that here, you'll be stopped. Your OS is a little nervous that you don't know what you're doing, but that's ok. We can reassure it from the command line.</p>
    <p><code>% unzip ~/Desktop/WordDoc-demo.zip</code>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Now, you'll see that wherever you have your document stored on your computer, a bunch of little strange folders and files have popped up alongside it. These are the supporting characters for your Word doc.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Step three: the MS Word doc in its true form</h3>
    <p>As we mentioned earlier, the basic form of an MS Word document is XML, which is written in a way that only the Microsoft program can read and execute. But, we can still look at it!&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We'll find the .xml file for this document in the "word" folder that's popped up, and from there we can view it in VS Code. So, let's navigate to that folder from wherever it exists on your machine. Mine is on my Desktop, so let's just assume we're already in the Desktop directory.</p>
    <p><code>% cd word</code>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Take a peek inside:</p>
    <p><code>% ls</code>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Here you'll see quite a few .xml files, but the one we're interested in is "document.xml." Do you remember the shortcut for opening a file in VS Code? This will only work if you've configured your Command Palette the way we described in the installation instructions.</p>
    <p><code>% code document.xml</code>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Again, that's a lot of stuff! And this is supposed to be the document in the screenshot at the top. If you want to find where that content is in this .xml file, you can search in VS Code by pressing Cmd + F (Mac) or Ctrl + F (Windows) and paste in the following: This is a Word Document with one sentence.</p>
    <p>Only 42 characters out of 2,859, but your core message is there.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While all of this is not to say that MS Word isn't a great product that you shouldn't use, we do hope that you've learned a bit more about what's actually going on behind the scenes so that you can make some more informed decisions about which formats you want to save some of your most precious writing... information tween Amanda is thrilled to have now.</p>
