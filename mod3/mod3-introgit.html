    <h2>What is Git?</h2>
    <p><strong>Git</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is software used for version control&mdash;that is, tracking the state of files. Using Git, you designate certain folders as repositories, then use commands to save the state of the repository at certain points in time. A<span>&nbsp;</span><em>repository</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is a place where things can be stored, and in this context indicates a folder that is being tracked by Git. You can perform tasks such as reverting back to previous versions of the repository, copying or sharing the repository across computers, and comparing different versions of a project.</p>
    <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
    <p><strong>GitHub</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is a cloud service for hosting Git repositories. It's something of a social network for programmers and is frequently used as a portfolio for sharing work. GitHub is used to share your code and writing with a wider community and also to find the code and writing of others. It can also be used to host websites.</p>
    <h2>What you can do with Git and GitHub</h2>
    <p>A<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://digitalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/spirosmithdh2016githubpresentationfinal.pdf">study of how Digital Humanists use GitHub</a>, conducted by Lisa Spiro and Sean Morey Smith, found that a wide range of users, including professors, research staff, graduate students, IT staff, and librarians commonly used the site in their DH work. They used GitHub for a diverse range of activities, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developing software</li>
        <li>Sharing data sets</li>
        <li>Creating websites</li>
        <li>Writing articles and books</li>
        <li>Collating online resources</li>
        <li>Keeping research notes</li>
        <li>Hosting syllabi and course materials</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why use GitHub?</h2>
    <p>Participants in the study said they found GitHub useful in their Digital Humanities work for several reasons. In particular, it facilitated:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sharing and backing up files on multiple computers</li>
        <li>Monitoring changes effectively</li>
        <li>Recovering from bugs or errors by going back in time before the error arose</li>
        <li>Using different branches for experiments and new directions</li>
        <li>Sharing and managing files with others&mdash;seeing who added what content and when</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why we like using Git and GitHub</h2>
    <h3>Sharing and attribution</h3>
    <p>As you can see as you look around the CDL's account, we use GitHub to store content as well as archive workshop materials, and sometimes even run the workshops themselves. This works well for us for a variety of reasons, but perhaps the most influential is the fact that we're able to "fork" (or, make a copy on our own account) repositories created and published by other individuals, institutions, or organizations and build off of them. This makes it a lot easier, and faster, to create and share robust, yet specifically CDL-oriented, content, because we're not starting completely from scratch!</p>
    <p>GitHub is an open source platform, meaning it's free to use and its source code is freely available to folks who may be interested in copying or contributing to it. This spirit of openness results in a strong sense of community amongst particularly skilled users who make sure it stays updated and secure; "by the people, for the people" and such. Another hardline value of the "open" community is proper attribution of content. You can't simply copy and rebrand something as your own without attributing the original creator. GitHub makes this easy by automatically providing a breadcrumb trail when you fork someone else's work.</p>

    <h3><span style="color: #000000;">Collaborative writing</span></h3>
    <p><span style="color: #000000;">Some folks use Git to track changes (<em>version control</em>&nbsp;in Git parlance) in writing projects, and find it to be a cleaner, more elegant solution than the Track Changes functionality in Microsoft Word.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: #000000;">Writing with co-authors is also easier and more secure when working with Git, and especially GitHub. We've already talked in this course about the issues that can occur when relying on word processors for writing large amounts of valuable text. Working with word processors on your own can be tricky, but sharing content between computers using word processors can get even more dicey. Working with co-authors in GitHub has the benefit of keeping everyone's versions of the draft up-to-date while keeping it securely on your own machine where you can work on it in your own preferred text editor.</span></p>
    <h3><span style="color: #000000;">Versions across time</span></h3>
    <p><span style="color: #000000;">Have you ever had a folder full of multiple and conflicting versions of documents that looked like this?</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: #000000;"><code>|
                --Documents
                |
                --Sociologypaper-draft.doc&nbsp;--Sociologypaper-revised.doc
                --Sociologypaper-FINAL.doc</code></span></p>
    <p>Sometimes we don't want to lose each draft or version of a paper we're writing, so we end up making multiple copies of it, which can clutter up our documents folder, desktop folder, or even Google Drive folders if that's where you write your assignments. Git allows you to work out of one document alone on your computer, keeping your files clean, organized, and minimal without losing any previous versions to the Trash.</p>
