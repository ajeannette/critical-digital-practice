    <p>In order to interact with GitHub from your machine's command line, you'll need to set up a communication protocol, which takes some configuring. No worries, though, we'll walk you through it here.</p>
    <p>Up until August 2020, we would use the HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure) method of connecting to the GitHub server. This method was recommended by GitHub for years, as it was considered sufficiently secure, but also very accessible to the widest variety of users, as the means of authentication is simply your GitHub username and password. However, in 2020, GitHub made the move to transition repository access almost completely away from HTTPS, changing its recommendation to a SSH (secure shell) protocol.</p>
    <h2>What is SSH?</h2>
    <p>SSH is a remote protocol used for securely executing commands on a server from your machine, and authenticates users via public-key cryptography. Public-key cryptography consists of a&nbsp;pair of keys that initiate a secure handshake between remote parties. The key pair contains a public and private key. The private vs public nomenclature can be confusing as they are both called keys. It's more helpful to think of the public key as a "lock" and the private key as the "key". You give the public "lock" to remote parties to encrypt or "lock" data. This data is then opened with the "private" key which you hold in a secure place.</p>
    <h3>What's so great about it?</h3>
    <p>I'm sure by now you've heard that 2-factor authentication is the new best practice for password security. Geneseo now requires us to have 2-factor authentication set up in order to log in to campus- and SUNY-related accounts. Since SSH connections are so much more secure than password-based connections, there is simply no need for 2-factor authentication, which avoids repetitive authentication actions and overall speeds up your interactions with GitHub.</p>
    <h2>Generating your SSH key</h2>
    <p>Follow the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instructions</a> provided by GitHub Docs to generate your SSH key pair. You can toggle between operating systems&mdash;Mac, Windows, and Linux&mdash; at the top of the page to personalize your instructions.</p>
    <p>Make sure that you continue the instructions through "Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent" so that you don't have to approve the key pair each time you want to interact with GitHub from your CLI, or input your passcode.</p>
