    <h2>Copyright</h2>
    <p>In the U.S., as soon as you make a creative work and fix it in a tangible form, you are now the copyright owner and nobody else can distribute or adapt that work without your permission (except in the case of fair use).<br />But what if you want your work to be widely distributed and built upon?<br />Copyright owners can apply <strong>licenses</strong> to their creative works that lessen the copyright restrictions and increase what others are allowed to do with their works. Since licenses are legal documents written in legal-ese, it can be hard for a lay-person to read a license and fully understand its permissions.<br />Fortunately, the vast majority of copyright owners of now use a small set of popular and well understood licenses. For creative works such as writing and multimedia, copyright owners can apply one of the <strong>Creative Commons</strong> licenses. For software, programmers can apply an <strong>open source</strong> license. Any type of creative work can be made available in the <strong>public domain</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Creative Commons</h2>
    <p>Creative Commons is a non-profit organization that offers<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="_8gcxk83" href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6 licenses for sharing creative work</a>.</p>
    <p>All of the licenses require attribution, to make sure the original author is credited for their work.</p>
    <p>The licenses differ in whether they also require these conditions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Share Alike: The reused work must be licensed using the same CC license as the original work.</li>
        <li>Non-Commercial: The reused work can only be used for non-commercial purposes.</li>
        <li>No Derivates: The original work can be distributed and displayed, but it cannot be modified.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Using CC-licensed content</h3>
    <p>According to the<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="_8gcxk83" href="https://stateof.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of the Commons</a><span>&nbsp;</span>in 2017, there were more than 1.4 billion CC-licensed works available online, a mix of images, videos, sound recordings, presentations, articles,<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="_8gcxk83" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_Creative_Commons_licensed_works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and more</a>.</p>
    <p>To sort through all that CC-licensed material, try using<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="_8gcxk83" href="https://search.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CreativeCommons search</a><span>&nbsp;</span>or Google Image Search,<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="_8gcxk83" href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/29508?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with results filtered based on license</a>.</p>
    <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/60de715f903bd492bf51f11c5c8c1f5ea14283d4.png" alt="Screenshot of Google search results for &quot;cute cat&quot;. Underneath the search bar, &quot;Images&quot; is selected on the left and &quot;Tools&quot; is selected on the right. The &quot;Usage rights&quot; dropdown displays 5 options, and &quot;Labeled for noncommercial reuse&quot; is selected." width="781" height="301" aria-hidden="true" /></p>
    <p>Above is a Google image search results with a "Usage rights" filter.</p>
    <p>Generally, if a creative work is available under a CC license, the license will be written near the work somewhere. It might be in an image caption or a video description, or it may even be in the footer of a website, if all of the content on the site is under the same CC license.</p>
    <p>Remember that when a content creator makes their work available under a CC license, they still have rights. As users and remixers of CC-licensed content, we have a legal obligation to respect the conditions of the license: to always provide attribution, and to only use the work if our remix satisfies all the conditions.</p>
    <h3>Making CC-licensed content</h3>
    <p>To host CC-licensed creative work on your own website, you can use<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="_8gcxk83" href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Creative Commons tool</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to choose a license and display it visibly near the work. If you use a content hosting site like YouTube or Flickr, they often provide a way for creators to specify a CC license for uploaded work.</p>
