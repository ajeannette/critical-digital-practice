<p>For creative works such as writing and multimedia, copyright owners can apply one of the&nbsp;Creative Commons&nbsp;licenses. For software, programmers can apply an&nbsp;open source&nbsp;license.</p>
<p>Computer software is often a lot more alike than it is different. Just consider the apps you use every day; they have user interfaces with buttons, forms, and menus, they authenticate user logins in the server code, and they store data in databases.</p>
<p>If software engineers had to write all of that code from scratch every time they built a new app, there would be a lot fewer websites and apps in the world. Instead, many software engineers build on the work of others, thanks to the growing availability of open source code.</p>
<h2>Open source licenses<span><br /></span></h2>
<p>When a programmer wants to make their code reusable, they publish it online under an open source license. That license enables other programmers to bring the code into their own projects, as long as their reuse meets the conditions of the license.</p>
<p>An example of a broad and permissive open source license is the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT license</a>. It allows for distribution, modification, commercial use, and private use of the code, as long as the copyright and license information are included in the reused code.</p>
<p>Khan Academy has several <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://khan.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source projects</a> and makes them all available under the MIT license. Every open source project has a LICENSE file in the main folder, and that license file specifies the license for every line of code in the project.</p>
<p>Here's the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT license file</a> for KaTeX, a JavaScript library that renders math equations:<span><br /></span></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://canvas.geneseo.edu/courses/20408/files/2144931/preview" alt="Screenshot of LICENSE file in KaTeX repository." width="504" height="274" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.geneseo.edu/api/v1/courses/20408/files/2144931" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
<p>There are a number of other open source licenses that software companies and programmers can attach to their codebases, and the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://opensource.org/licenses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular licenses</a> are tracked by the Open Source Initiative.</p>
<p>Some open source licenses are "copyleft", a similar restriction as the "share alike" condition for Creative Commons licenses. When you use open source software with a copyleft license, your derivative software typically must be distributed with a copyleft license as well.</p>
<h2>Using open-source code</h2>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
    <div class="paragraph">There are many benefits to using open source software in a codebase:</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
    <ul>
        <li>Software engineers no longer need to write the code that's available from the open-source project and can spend their time writing code that's specific to their product.</li>
        <li>There are often multiple open source projects with similar goals, such as the hundreds of drag-and-drop JavaScript libraries that are available online. A software engineer can quickly try out libraries and choose the best one for their needs, without having to pay money or negotiate permission.</li>
        <li>Popular open source projects have multiple contributors, so their <strong>maintenance and improvement does not depend on a sole engineer or a particular company</strong>. About<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="_8gcxk83" href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2017/10/2017-linux-kernel-report-highlights-developers-roles-accelerating-pace-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15,600 developers</a><span>&nbsp;</span>from more than 1,400 companies contributed to the open-source Linux operating system from 2005-2017.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are also drawbacks, with security being one of the biggest concerns. Since anyone can look at open source code, a hacker could find a vulnerability in the code and then use their knowledge of that vulnerability to carry out cyber attacks. Even worse, they could submit a code change to an open source codebase that introduces a new vulnerability.</p>
    <p>In July 2018, an attacker introduced code into a <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://eslint.org/blog/2018/07/postmortem-for-malicious-package-publishes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular JavaScript tool</a> that stole authentication credentials for thousands of users. A few months after, another attacker <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced code into a JS library</a> that harvested account details from users of a cryptocurrency wallet app.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>That being said, the very fact that the source code is open and available means that many people have the opportunity to combat cyber attacks as quickly as they come. The more popular an open source code is, the more eyes on it from both sides.</p>
