## What\'s this course all about?

This course was originally offered through the Center for Digital Learning at
Geneseo as a primer for students accepted into the Student Affiliate
program.

**This course is a sampler, if you will, of topics, skills, tools, and
ethics related to computing, particularly associated with higher
education.** You\'ll learn a bit about the history of computers and
computing, text editing, working with your computer using built-in tools
like the command line, what the web is (versus the internet) and how to
create web content, and how to share your content. Throughout these
modules, we\'ll talk about the technical quite a bit, but also spend
some time discussing the theoretical and the societal implications of
digital practice.
