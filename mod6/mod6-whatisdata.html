<h2>I'm not a scientist so I don't use data... right?</h2>
<p>Wrong! Data is everywhere, and everyone uses it, even folks in the humanities. In fact, data is very much about storytelling; it helps us make sense of the world around us, and be able to talk about that world in informed ways. The sooner you can identify where and how data exists in your life, as well as be comfortable with speaking knowledgeably about data as a concept, the better.</p>
<p>According to Javiera Atenas in their contribution to <em>Understanding Data Praxis and Practice</em>, "Data are characteristics or information, usually numerical, that are collected through observation."</p>
<p>Observation is an interesting aspect of data collection. Traditionally, data collection has been an intentional act, but since the rise of our digital civilization it has become more and more passive, built into the structures that we interact with every, and sometimes all, day. This passivity, while convenient for data collectors, makes avoiding data collection an actual challenge for the typical digital citizen if they'd prefer; it's sneaky, it's pervasive, and it's largely "opt-out" rather than "opt-in," making it the default for all of our online interactions. So, we're effectively moving past the act of "observation" related to data collection, slipping more and more easily and comfortably into "surveillance."</p>
