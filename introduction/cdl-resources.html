<h2>CDL Partners</h2>

<p>Contact CIT with any issues or concerns about Canvas specifically. If you're having any issues with your computer that aren't related to the skills we're working on, contact CIT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CIT is also where the digital experts reside. If there are topics or skills we cover that you're interested in learning more about, we can always set up a time to speak with one or more of these experts as a group or individually.</p>
<p><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.geneseo.edu/library" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fraser Hall Library</a></p>
<p>The librarians and staff at Fraser Hall have a variety of specialities and skills that greatly benefit our work. We recommend contacting Jon Grunert, Scholarly Communications Librarian (<a href="mailto:grunert@geneseo.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grunert@geneseo.edu</a>) for any questions related to digital publishing, open education/open publishing, and more, Allison Brown, Digital Publishing Services Manager (<a href="mailto:browna@geneseo.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">browna@geneseo.edu</a>) for any questions related to digital publishing, open education/open publishing, and digital design, as well as specific tools like WordPress, Pressbooks, Scalar, and other publishing platforms.</p>
<p><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.geneseo.edu/accessibility-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of Accessibility</a></p>
<p>The Office of Accessibility is not only an essential resource for navigating accommodation services, but a fantastic resource for departments across campus to assess how accessible their work and services are to students. If you're interested in better understanding digital accessibility and best practices, this is the office for you. While we will certainly cover issues relating to digital accessibility, but this is where the experts are.</p>
