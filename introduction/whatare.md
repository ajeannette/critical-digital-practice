By now, you\'ve seen the term Critical Digital Practices a LOT.

You\'re probably wondering, what does that even mean? What are digital
practices? How can they be critical?

The best way to start thinking about this topic is to consider the
practice of critical thinking. You\'ve probably been told many times
before now that we should all strive to be critical thinkers, especially
in \"today\'s world.\" Today\'s world, with its misinformation, deep
fakes, and highly edited and filtered realities both on the internet and
in the media. What does thinking critically about these things look
like? 

Critical thinking requires us to make space for asking questions and
connecting what we\'re encountering to relevant issues, considering
possible implications one might have on the other. So, when confronted
with a new piece of technology, for example, we\'re able to resist the
typical modern instinct to unquestioningly embrace it and, instead,
consider what it will actually do for us, its creators, and our society,
both good and bad, to some extent before making a well-informed decision
about whether and in what contexts we should engage with it. It\'s this
quality of critical thinking that we\'re eager to incorporate into what
we refer to as Critical Digital Practices.

Essentially, we define Critical Digital Practices as knowing how to do
very practical things in digital spaces, with digital tools and methods,
all while being intentional, cognizant, skeptical, and evaluative.

### An argument for Luddism

In his piece titled [\"Toward a Luddite
Pedagogy\"](https://hybridpedagogy.org/toward-luddite-pedagogy/){.inline_disabled
target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Torn
Halves](https://hybridpedagogy.org/author/torn/){.inline_disabled
target="_blank" rel="noopener"} writes an argument for Luddism,
specifically as it relates to pedagogy and educational technology
(edtech), but try to think about how it applies to a more general
digital reality.

> An especially objectionable feature of the edtech discourse is its use
> of the word "Luddite" as a term of abuse. Uttering "You're a Luddite"
> to the edtech sceptic is an act of verbal expectoration that is
> supposed to end the conversation, dismissing the sceptic as someone
> suffering from an intellectually crippling phobia.
>
> The time has come to take a stand against this thoughtless use of
> "Luddite" in the pejorative. The historical record needs to be set
> straight, and it needs to be set straight as a prelude to defending a
> Luddite approach to education.
>
> The record:[ The Luddites](http://ludditelink.org.uk/history.php) (who
> were groups of textile artisans in various parts of England in the
> early 19th century) were not flatly opposed to new technology. They
> destroyed selected types of machinery in carefully chosen factories
> (usually owned by the most unscrupulous and exploitative
> industrialists) because this was a tried and tested means for the
> voiceless to put pressure on the new power brokers. There was no
> interest in destroying other kinds of new technology.
>
> Nor were the Luddites flatly opposed to progress, simply defending all
> the old privileges of a trade that used to bring in a relatively good
> income. No, Luddism at its most articulate was a movement inspired by
> the prospects for radical political change opened up by the French
> Revolution. Luddite leaders issued[ written
> declarations](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NG6ABlDQ10MC&pg=PA200&lpg=PA200&dq=george+mellor+hanged+horsfall+luddite&source=bl&ots=Nchd9TKgN3&sig=Z2x9LK6beR0BS3OT8v0IM09-1rQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=t0SsU_H7OOSt0QXOlIAo&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=george%20mellor%20hanged%20horsfall%20luddite&f=false) making
> it plain that the attacks were part of a revolt against old and new
> forms of tyranny.[ One
> declaration](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QKHIJpSnBTIC&pg=PT538&dq=%22in+shaking+off+the+Yoke+of+the+Rottenest,+Wickedest+and+most+Tyranious%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=c4e1U9bvF8bM0AXuhoHoAw&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22in%20shaking%20off%20the%20Yoke%20of%20the%20Rottenest%2C%20Wickedest%20and%20most%20Tyranious%22&f=false),
> for instance, spoke of the hope that aid from revolutionary France
> would arrive to help them "in shaking off the Yoke of the Rottenest,
> Wickedest and most Tyranious \[sic\] Government that ever existed;
> then down come the Hanover Tyrants, and all our Tyrants from the
> greatest to the smallest and we will be governed by a just Republic."
> And to that was added the thought that "the wish and Prayer of
> millions in the Land \[is that\] the Almighty hasten those happy
> Times."
>
> With the echoes of the French (and American) declarations in their
> ears, the Luddites stood up to the first line of tyrants confronting
> them in their communities: the new industrialists -- people
> tyrannically lowering human dignity --- reducing people (often
> children) to low-paid machine-minders whose fates depended entirely
> upon the whims of the factory owner, and who were denied any say in
> what was happening.
>
> And far from being crippled by phobias, the Luddites were willing to
> risk their lives to make their vision of a new political order into a
> reality. Not only was machine-breaking a capital offence, but the
> Luddites were perceived to be such a threat to the entire oligarchic
> political establishment that it was made a capital offence simply to
> swear an oath of allegiance to them.

It\'s up to those of us who are interested in and knowledgeable of
digital practices to keep a careful eye on digital developments,
weighing them against the good of our fellow community members.

Through this course, you will learn many skills, most of which can be
broken up under the following categories:

-   **Digital familiarity:** *understanding file navigation and
    efficient computer setup, as well as the difference between plain
    text and word processing in digital writing.* This step will be the
    essential foundation for moving forward with our curriculum. For
    some, these will already be familiar concepts, while for others this
    will be the first time the curtain has been \"pulled back,\" so to
    speak, from the way their computers and the basic digital world
    works; both starting points are completely fine and, in fact,
    provide an opportunity for folks to learn with and from each other.
    At this point, you might find yourself wondering, \"Should I have
    known this already?\", \"Why is this important?\", \"How did I get
    this far without these skills?\" as you work through this concept.
    Be patient with the content and yourself, and get accustomed to the
    growing pains.
-   **Direct communication with your computer:** *learning how to
    communicate with your computer separately from the graphical user
    interface (GUI), at a more direct level.* This is where things might
    start to feel uncomfortable, but it\'s also when it starts to get
    pretty fun! We\'ll learn a bit about how computers as we know them
    came to be, and how we can communicate with them in a way that\'s
    closer to their native language: from the Command Line. You\'ll find
    that there is a lot that you can do to influence how your computer
    works and how it understands your needs when you\'re not constrained
    to working with the GUI as a selective interpreter. Queue up some
    *The Matrix* theme music and dive in!
-   **Digital editing with version control:** *using Git to track
    changes you\'ve made to your digital projects right from your own
    machine and for collaborating with others across the web.* We\'ll
    learn how to use this powerful tool from the Command Line to keep
    careful track of our digital projects on your own machine, then
    we\'ll learn how to transfer those projects to the web, where you
    can collaborate with others while maintaining careful control over
    each version through a site called GitHub. Learning how to use Git
    and GitHub are key skills for digital humanists and programmers
    alike; with these skills, you\'ll be able to easily show off your
    skills, collect collaborators, and find other open source projects
    you can contribute to yourself! What\'s open source, you ask? We\'ll
    get into that a bit later\...
-   **From your computer to The Web:** *learning HTML and CSS to create
    webpages and communicate with browsers.* We\'ve learned how to talk
    to our computers, now we need to talk to the web, which is done
    through its browsers. While there are plenty of fancy tools and
    applications that can make websites for us---think WordPress,
    SquareSpace, Winx, etc.---it\'s important to understand what they
    are built around so that we can realize what\'s possible when
    utilizing them, or to circumvent them completely and build our own
    spaces on the web. 
-   **Open scholarship and The Commons:** *understanding creator rights
    on the web, and how we can leverage our rights as creators to
    promote a community of access, sharing, and growth*. What good is
    scholarship if you can\'t share it and allow others to build upon
    it? In this section of the course, we\'ll talk about the ways that
    we can share knowledge and resources in responsible ways that
    respect the rights of creators as well as consumers. 

We\'ll wrap up the course with a reflective final project that will roll
all of these skills together into a personal portfolio on the [Geneseo
OpenLab](https://geneseo.sunycreate.cloud/) website.
