    <p>By now, you've seen the term Critical Digital Practices a LOT.</p>
    <p>You're probably wondering, what does that even mean? What are digital practices? How can they be critical?</p>
    <p>The best way to start thinking about this topic is to consider the practice of critical thinking. You've probably been told many times before now that we should all strive to be critical thinkers, especially in "today's world." Today's world, with its misinformation, deep fakes, and highly edited and filtered realities both on the internet and in the media. What does thinking critically about these things look like?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Critical thinking requires us to make space for asking questions and connecting what we're encountering to relevant issues, considering possible implications one might have on the other. So, when confronted with a new piece of technology, for example, we're able to resist the typical modern instinct to unquestioningly embrace it and, instead, consider what it will actually do for us, its creators, and our society, both good and bad, to some extent before making a well-informed decision about whether and in what contexts we should engage with it. It's this quality of critical thinking that we're eager to incorporate into what we refer to as Critical Digital Practices.</p>
    <p>Essentially, we define Critical Digital Practices as&nbsp;knowing how to do very practical things in digital spaces, with digital tools and methods, all while being intentional, cognizant, skeptical, and evaluative.</p>
    <h3>An argument for Luddism</h3>
    <p>In his piece titled <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://hybridpedagogy.org/toward-luddite-pedagogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Toward a Luddite Pedagogy"</a>, <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://hybridpedagogy.org/author/torn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Torn Halves</a> writes an argument for Luddism, specifically as it relates to pedagogy and educational technology (edtech), but try to think about how it applies to a more general digital reality.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p dir="ltr">An especially objectionable feature of the edtech discourse is its use of the word &ldquo;Luddite&rdquo; as a term of abuse. Uttering &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Luddite&rdquo; to the edtech sceptic is an act of verbal expectoration that is supposed to end the conversation, dismissing the sceptic as someone suffering from an intellectually crippling phobia.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">The time has come to take a stand against this thoughtless use of &ldquo;Luddite&rdquo; in the pejorative. The historical record needs to be set straight, and it needs to be set straight as a prelude to defending a Luddite approach to education.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">The record:<a href="http://ludditelink.org.uk/history.php"><span>&nbsp;</span>The Luddites</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(who were groups of textile artisans in various parts of England in the early 19th century) were not flatly opposed to new technology. They destroyed selected types of machinery in carefully chosen factories (usually owned by the most unscrupulous and exploitative industrialists) because this was a tried and tested means for the voiceless to put pressure on the new power brokers. There was no interest in destroying other kinds of new technology.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">Nor were the Luddites flatly opposed to progress, simply defending all the old privileges of a trade that used to bring in a relatively good income. No, Luddism at its most articulate was a movement inspired by the prospects for radical political change opened up by the French Revolution. Luddite leaders issued<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NG6ABlDQ10MC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=george+mellor+hanged+horsfall+luddite&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Nchd9TKgN3&amp;sig=Z2x9LK6beR0BS3OT8v0IM09-1rQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t0SsU_H7OOSt0QXOlIAo&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=george%20mellor%20hanged%20horsfall%20luddite&amp;f=false"><span>&nbsp;</span>written declarations</a><span>&nbsp;</span>making it plain that the attacks were part of a revolt against old and new forms of tyranny.<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QKHIJpSnBTIC&amp;pg=PT538&amp;dq=%22in+shaking+off+the+Yoke+of+the+Rottenest,+Wickedest+and+most+Tyranious%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c4e1U9bvF8bM0AXuhoHoAw&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22in%20shaking%20off%20the%20Yoke%20of%20the%20Rottenest%2C%20Wickedest%20and%20most%20Tyranious%22&amp;f=false"><span>&nbsp;</span>One declaration</a>, for instance, spoke of the hope that aid from revolutionary France would arrive to help them &ldquo;in shaking off the Yoke of the Rottenest, Wickedest and most Tyranious [sic] Government that ever existed; then down come the Hanover Tyrants, and all our Tyrants from the greatest to the smallest and we will be governed by a just Republic.&rdquo; And to that was added the thought that &ldquo;the wish and Prayer of millions in the Land [is that] the Almighty hasten those happy Times.&rdquo;</p>
        <p dir="ltr">With the echoes of the French (and American) declarations in their ears, the Luddites stood up to the first line of tyrants confronting them in their communities: the new industrialists &ndash; people tyrannically lowering human dignity &mdash; reducing people (often children) to low-paid machine-minders whose fates depended entirely upon the whims of the factory owner, and who were denied any say in what was happening.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">And far from being crippled by phobias, the Luddites were willing to risk their lives to make their vision of a new political order into a reality. Not only was machine-breaking a capital offence, but the Luddites were perceived to be such a threat to the entire oligarchic political establishment that it was made a capital offence simply to swear an oath of allegiance to them.</p>

    <p dir="ltr">It's up to those of us who are interested in and knowledgeable of digital practices to keep a careful eye on digital developments, weighing them against the good of our fellow community members.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Through this course, you will learn many skills, most of which can be broken up under the following categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Digital familiarity:</strong> <em>understanding file navigation and efficient computer setup, as well as the difference between plain text and word processing in digital writing.</em> This step will be the essential foundation for moving forward with our curriculum. For some, these will already be familiar concepts, while for others this will be the first time the curtain has been "pulled back," so to speak, from the way their computers and the basic digital world works; both starting points are completely fine and, in fact, provide an opportunity for folks to learn with and from each other. At this point, you might find yourself wondering, "Should I have known this already?", "Why is this important?", "How did I get this far without these skills?" as you work through this concept. Be patient with the content and yourself, and get accustomed to the growing pains.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct communication with your computer:</strong>&nbsp;<em>learning how to communicate with your computer separately from the graphical user interface (GUI), at a more direct level.</em> This is where things might start to feel uncomfortable, but it's also when it starts to get pretty fun! We'll learn a bit about how computers as we know them came to be, and how we can communicate with them in a way that's closer to their native language: from the Command Line. You'll find that there is a lot that you can do to influence how your computer works and how it understands your needs when you're not constrained to working with the GUI as a selective interpreter. Queue up some <em>The Matrix</em> theme music and dive in!</li>
        <li><strong>Digital editing with version control:</strong>&nbsp;<em>using Git to track changes you've made to your digital projects right from your own machine and for collaborating with others across the web.</em> We'll learn how to use this powerful tool from the Command Line to keep careful track of our digital projects on your own machine, then we'll learn how to transfer those projects to the web, where you can collaborate with others while maintaining careful control over each version through a site called GitHub. Learning how to use Git and GitHub are key skills for digital humanists and programmers alike; with these skills, you'll be able to easily show off your skills, collect collaborators, and find other open source projects you can contribute to yourself! What's open source, you ask? We'll get into that a bit later...</li>
        <li><strong>From your computer to The Web:</strong>&nbsp;<em>learning HTML and CSS to create webpages and communicate with browsers.</em> We've learned how to talk to our computers, now we need to talk to the web, which is done through its browsers. While there are plenty of fancy tools and applications that can make websites for us&mdash;think WordPress, SquareSpace, Winx, etc.&mdash;it's important to understand what they are built around so that we can realize what's possible when utilizing them, or to circumvent them completely and build our own spaces on the web.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Open scholarship and The Commons:</strong>&nbsp;<em>understanding creator rights on the web, and how we can leverage our rights as creators to promote a community of access, sharing, and growth</em>. What good is scholarship if you can't share it and allow others to build upon it? In this section of the course, we'll talk about the ways that we can share knowledge and resources in responsible ways that respect the rights of creators as well as consumers.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We'll wrap up the course with a reflective final project that will roll all of these skills together into a personal portfolio on the <a href="https://geneseo.sunycreate.cloud/">Geneseo OpenLab</a> website.</p>
