GitHub


GitHub is an open source online platform that utilizes the git versioning software, allowing you to collaborate on coding and text-based projects with others over the internet, while doing all of your work on your own machine and then "pushing" it to the online repository using your computer's command line to share it with your collaborators.

We'll be using this platform and software to submit your weekly journal entries as well as your research post(s).
